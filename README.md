## Access

Sugimotocho Station (杉本町駅)  is the nearest station to Osaka Metropolitan University (Sugimoto Campus).
Here is a [map of JR train](https://masataka123.github.io/Kobayashi_Hitchin/material/hanwa.pdf).
In this map, "R26" denotes Sugimotocho Station (杉本町駅).

 If you need further assistance (for example, how to get to Sugimotocho Station from Kansai International Airport), please refer to [this link](https://www.omu.ac.jp/orp/ocami-en/about/directions/).


<!--
It takes 5 minites on foot from Sugimoto-cho Station to the conference room.

In this map, "12E" denotes Faculty of Science, Bldg. E. 

## Other informations
There is a hotel around Tennoji (天王寺) or Nishinari (西成) where you can stay for around 3,000 yen.  
However, it is not a  good hotel, so we do not recommend you book it.
